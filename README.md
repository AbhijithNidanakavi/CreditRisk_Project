# Credit_RiskInsight: Leveraging SHAP and DeepChecks for Credit Card Default Prediction

This project focuses on enhancing the predictive performance and interpretability of a credit card default prediction model. The study utilizes the ADASYN algorithm for class balancing and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) along with DeepChecks for model interpretation. NEPTUNE is a machine learning experiment tracking tool that helps data scientists and machine learning engineers keep track of their experiments, hyperparameters, and results. The findings reveal insights into the key features influencing credit card defaults and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining class balancing techniques with advanced interpretability methods for improved model performance and decision-making in the financial sector.
